# CS310 Mobile Application: SUHub
## Description
Our project is a community-based feedback and discussion platform designed specifically for Sabancı University students. The application allows users to share opinions, experiences, and reviews about different aspects of university life — including courses, dining options, dormitories, and campus facilities. The app combines the idea of open discussion and anonymous feedback to create an engaging, interactive, and informative space within the university community.

## Main Purpose & The Problem to Solve
The problem, the app aims to solve, is the lack of a centralized and student-oriented platform where experiences and feedback about the university can be easily shared and accessed. Many students struggle to find accurate information about courses, or campus life before making important decisions. Our platform fills this gap by providing a trustworthy, student-driven source of information and discussion.
